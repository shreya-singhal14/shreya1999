                    Udacity, Inc. is a for-profit educational organization founded by Sebastian Thrun, David Stavens, and Mike Sokolsky offering massive open online courses (MOOCs).[5]
                    According to Thrun, the origin of the name Udacity comes from the company's desire to be "audacious for you, the student".[6][7] While it originally focused on offering university-style courses, it now focuses more on vocational courses for professionals.
                    Udacity is the outgrowth of free computer science classes offered in 2011 through Stanford University.[8] Thrun has stated he hopes half a million students will enroll, after an enrollment of 160,000 students in the predecessor course at Stanford, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,[9] and 90,000 students had enrolled in the initial two classes as of March 2012.
